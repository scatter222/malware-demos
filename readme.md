### README: Setting Up .NET 7 SDK on Oracle Linux and Building Executables

Both the process injection and the beaconing client will add an autorun registry key for some persistence detection aswell
Keys will be MyMalware1 and MyMalware2 located in SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run

### Beaconing
This requires the beaconing client and the beaconing c2.
The beaconing C2 should be launched first - it 'should' create a webserver on http://localhost:5000

Then launch the beaconing client - it will ask for the C2 url, enter 'http://localhost:5000/beacon'
Dont forget the /beacon


### Process injection
When this is run it will show a list of all the running processes in the console with a number to the left
Type the number of the process you want it inject into.

Currently this just injects some shellcode commonly seen in Emotet.
Its just a dcryption function but its well known and has a yara sig - see [here](Win32.Trojan.Emotet.yara)

### Installing .NET 7 SDK on Oracle Linux

1. **Update Package Index**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update
   ```

2. **Install the .NET SDK**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install -y dotnet-sdk-7.0
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```

### Building and Producing Executables

1. **Change Directory to the relevant sample**
   ```bash
   cd beaconing
   ```

2. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Publish the Project as a Self-Contained Executable**
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true
   ```

5. **Locate the Executable**
   The executable file will be located in the `bin/Release/net7.0/win-x64/publish/` directory within your project folder.
